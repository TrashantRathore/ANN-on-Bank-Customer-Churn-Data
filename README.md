# ANN-on-Bank-Customer-Churn-Data
Performed Simple yet effective model using Artificial Neural Network on Bank Customer Churn Data
1. The problem statement in this picture is whether the Customers of the Bank who are current customers and future ones when a customer of bank would leave the bank with several factors affecting that bank account closing decision made by customer.
2. The Outcome of this problem would be that bank would easily be able to recity the points and areas where from their side they are lacking or not providing enough support to customer that is leading to customers leaving the bank.
3. We started with data where we have several predictors responsible for exiting of a customer from bank like, Credit Score, Region, Gender, Tenure of customers and few more factors and then we have a prediction label i.e "Exited" which directly invokes whether the customer with all those different values of predictors has left( closed his bank account) or not represented in form of binary data.
4. Here I applied basic techniques like Data Exploration numerically and Visually using help of Seaborn, Matplot libraries, then performed Data Cleaning, Outlier Detection, Data Transformation i.e converting alphabetical, categorical features to numerical using Label and One Hot Encoder but during EDA we got to found out that dataset was imbalance in 80:20 ratio so we went ahead with model building part.
5. While Model Building I took a random keras Sequential Neural Network with random Hyperparameters and build out a model out of it and saved the results for further examination as the dataset label was imbalanced,
6. Next what we did was to use Oversampling technique i.e "SMOTE" for our training data and then using help of a module of "keras_tuner" library i.e RandomSearch we build a model by hyperparameters tuning and trained it on "Balanced" new training data after sampling and in last evaluate the model on initial test data before sampling cause we did not performed any type of sampling on test data as that would lead to Data Leakage eventually a Dumb Model.
7. In the last I took the 'auc_roc_score' of both the results before and after sampling and plotted those results on ROC Curve to compare those results and get clear outcome from it as "Accuracy" is not the correct metric for Performance checking for imbalance data so we looked more into recall, precision and f1-score.
